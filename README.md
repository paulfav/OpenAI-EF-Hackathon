# OpenAI-EF-Hackathon: AI-Augmented Financial Advisor
## Overview
On September 7, 2023, in San Francisco, RaphaÃ«l Levisse and I participated in an overnight hackathon organized by Entrepreneur First and OpenAI. The project's focus was on developing an AI-augmented financial advisor capable of curating personalized investment portfolios. This advanced system takes into account various client parameters such as areas of interest, risk aversion, and net worth to build portfolios optimized for minimum variance or maximum Sharpe ratio. The final output is conveniently displayed on a user-friendly Streamlit webpage.
